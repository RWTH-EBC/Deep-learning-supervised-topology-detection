# Automated simulation tool

This is a tool for the automatation of the simulations with Dymola.

The different names of the approaches and the models can be better undertood by reading the Master Thesis of Bel√©n Llopis.

It is important to have a copy of the repository of `AixLib` Modelica Library (from here: https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib) and install the Dymola-Python interface (here the indications: https://github.com/RWTH-EBC/AixLib/wiki/How-to:-Dymola-Python-Interface)


## Contents
The folder `Automated_Simulation_Tool`contains different elements.

### Approach_1
In this folder the tool takes numerical parameters to change in the model from al input matrix in a `.txt` file. It uses only one Modelica file `.mo`. 

### Approach_2
In this folder the tool takes different boundary conditions to change in the model from al input matrix in a `.txt` file. It creates only as much Modelica files `.mo` as simulations wants to be done, and executes one model by one.
